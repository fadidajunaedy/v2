# Learning on My Own

I didn’t have many close friends, and even in college, I only had a few people I could really connect with. Our interests often didn’t align, and the more I dived into web development, the more it felt like I was walking a solitary path. I found myself learning on my own, without any study partners or a group to collaborate with. Being an introvert added to the challenge. I struggled to step into communities or find people to learn with. Maybe I was just too shy, or maybe I was afraid of putting myself out there, but whatever the reason, it made the process of learning even harder. There were times when I came across challenges and had no one to turn to for help. My only option was to rely on Google and AI for answers—solitary, yet somehow comforting, but still, it made me feel quite isolated.

Learning web development by myself often felt overwhelming, as there was so much to figure out on my own. The journey was both rewarding and tough, and though I’ve made it this far, I sometimes wonder how much more I could have learned with the right support and collaboration. But I’ve come to realize that while learning alone can be lonely, it’s also shaped me into a more independent learner. I’ve learned to embrace the challenges, become resourceful, and trust my own instincts. Sure, there are times I wish I had a learning partner or mentor, but I know that the journey is mine to take. And who knows, maybe one day I’ll have the opportunity to collaborate with others who share the same passion for web development.
