Toward the end of my university days, after defending my thesis, I started thinking about what to do while waiting for graduation. I’d done some freelance work before and gained decent experience, but it always felt like something was missing—there was no clear contract or structure to it. Then, a senior colleague mentioned an internship opening at an environmental NGO. Initially, I planned to explore other options, but with household expenses piling up, graduation fees looming, and no guarantee of another chance like this, I decided to go for it.

My job there was to enhance the performance of their existing website by rebuilding it, switching from Laravel to React.js and a REST API with Node.js. As a Full Stack Web Developer, I felt overwhelmed since it was my first job like this. I expected mentorship from seniors, like in a tech company or software house, but it was an environmental NGO, so I couldn’t rely on that. I had to figure out all the technical problems by myself, which was risky because I wasn’t very experienced and worried about causing losses if my work wasn’t good enough.

After around six months, I finished the internship successfully. I improved the website’s performance by changing the tech stack and also made a web-based HRIS app for their management. There were some complaints, but the work environment was comfortable, and the people were nice, even though it was quite different from my technical background as a developer.
