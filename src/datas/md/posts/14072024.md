# How I Ended Up Choosing Web Development

My journey into web development began during my time in vocational high school (SMK). At my school, we were introduced to various fields of programming, including web development, desktop applications, and mobile development. However, I was limited by the outdated specifications of my laptop—a Vaio with only 2GB of RAM and running on Windows XP. In 2017, this setup was already considered quite obsolete, and my laptop struggled to handle more demanding tasks like developing desktop or mobile applications. My laptop simply couldn’t handle the demands of other programming environments, which led me to focus solely on web development.

Rather than feeling frustrated by the limitations, I decided to embrace what was within my reach. Web development turned out to be a perfect fit for me. It was lightweight enough to run on my underpowered laptop, and getting started was incredibly simple. All I needed was a browser (which, of course, was already installed) and a basic text editor. This made web development one of the easiest and most accessible fields to dive into, and it became the area where I could truly excel without constantly feeling behind my classmates in other programming disciplines.

Over time, I grew more passionate about web development. The ability to create websites and applications that anyone could access with just a browser fascinated me. It was a field that offered immediate results and endless opportunities to learn and improve. What started as a necessity due to my hardware limitations eventually became a genuine interest and a career path I am excited to pursue.

Although web development is where my focus has been, I am open to exploring other areas in technology. I recognize the value of continuous learning and am not limiting myself to just one field. The world of technology is vast, and I look forward to expanding my knowledge and skills in the future.
