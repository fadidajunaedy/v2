# Case Study: DreamCost Application

## Overview

**DreamCost** is a web application that helps users estimate the future price of an item by taking into account the annual inflation rate.

## Why I Built This

As a web developer, I created **DreamCost** based on my own experiences. I often want to buy things—like a gadget or something useful—but I don’t always have the money right away. So, I’d plan to save up and buy it later. The problem was, I never knew how much the price would increase by the time I had enough cash. It frustrated me not knowing how much I’d actually need to save. One day, I thought, “Why not build a tool to figure this out?” That’s how **DreamCost** started. I wanted a simple way to estimate future prices, especially for someone like me who has to save up first, and I figured other people might find it useful too. It’s just a practical solution I coded to solve a real-life problem I kept running into.

## Problem Statement

Inflation causes prices to rise over time, but most people—including me—don’t have an easy way to calculate how it affects the stuff they want to buy. For example, if I’m eyeing a laptop that costs Rp8,000,000 today, I have no idea what it’ll cost in 3 years with inflation. Without a clear estimate, saving feels like guessing, and it’s hard to set a realistic target. A lot of people face this: they want to plan for a purchase, but they don’t know how prices will shift, which messes up their financial planning.

## Solution

**DreamCost** is a straightforward tool I built to tackle this. Users just:

1. Open the app at [https://dreamcost.vercel.app/](https://dreamcost.vercel.app/).
2. Enter the number of years you want to achieve or purchase the item.
3. Enter the current price of the item.
4. Enter the down payment you plan to make (100% if you want to pay the full amount upfront).
5. Specify the relevant annual inflation rate.
6. Click "Calculate Dream" to see the future price of the item.

It’s simple but does the job—giving people a clear target to aim for when saving. I also added a feature to save multiple items, so users can compare what’s worth prioritizing.

## Reflection and Result

I started using it myself, and honestly, it’s been pretty handy. It’s given me a clearer idea of how much I need to save for things I’ve got my eye on—like a new gadget or some gear—by showing me how prices might climb. I feel good about it because it does what I set out to achieve: takes the guesswork out of my planning. I hope others can use it too and find it just as helpful for figuring out their own saving goals. There’s still room to tweak it—like maybe adding live inflation data—but for now, it’s a solid tool that works for me and, hopefully, for anyone else who needs it.

## Conclusion

**DreamCost** shows how a simple web app can make a difference in planning finances, especially for people who need to save up like I do. It started as a personal fix, but it turns out it’s useful for others too. In the future, I might add stuff like a savings calculator or auto-updated inflation rates if I get the chance. This project taught me that the best ideas sometimes come from the little problems you face yourself—and that coding can turn them into something real.
