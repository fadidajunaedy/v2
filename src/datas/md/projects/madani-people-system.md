# Madani People System

Madani People System is a Human Resources Information System (HRIS) designed to streamline and elevate the management of human resources within the Madani organization, serving as a centralized digital platform that supports a wide range of HR tasks while driving efficiency through process digitization. This system simplifies critical functions such as payroll submissions, ensuring accurate and timely processing, and facilitates performance evaluations by providing tools for goal-setting, progress tracking, and feedback, while also offering an array of additional features like leave and permission requests, procurement management, recruitment processes, consultant coordination, and travel assignment tracking, all integrated into a single, user-friendly interface. Employees can effortlessly access self-service options—such as submitting leave or permission requests, viewing payslips, initiating procurement needs, or managing travel itineraries—while HR teams benefit from advanced capabilities like recruitment workflows to streamline hiring, consultant management for external expertise, and detailed reporting for workforce analytics, all of which enhance decision-making and compliance with organizational policies.
